Detail

## About Great Expectations:

Great Expectations provides a robust framework for data validation, data profiling, and data documentation. It allows data teams to define and manage explicit, declarative assertions about the acceptable state of their data, which are called Expectations.  

The primary purpose of Great Expectations is to ensure data quality and build trust in data assets throughout the data lifecycle, from ingestion to final analysis.  As such it can be implemented in different steps in the lifecycle, often in multiple steps within the same pipeline.

### Key Benefits:  

Advantages of using Great Expectations include:

* **Automated Data Quality:** Automated data validation against business logic and quality standards, significantly reducing manual effort and error risk. 
* **Data Structure (Schema) Validation** - This type of validation focuses on the form and metadata of your data. It ensures that the data is organized exactly as expected, which is crucial for downstream systems and models that rely on a fixed schema. 
* **Prevents Downstream Errors:** By validating data early in the pipeline (e.g. data ingestion), it helps catch issues quickly before bad data can corrupt production systems, models, or reports.  
* **Living Documentation:** Automatically generated Data Docs serve as a continuously updated source of truth, documenting both the expected state of the data and the observed results from recent validation runs.  
* **Integration Flexibility:** It integrates easily with popular data environments like Pandas, Spark, SQL databases, and workflow orchestrators.  

### Key Uses and Functionality:

* **Data Validation:** It checks data against a defined set of Expectations (rules) and provides clear Validation Results showing whether the data passes or fails. It can also return unexpected values for quick debugging.  
* **Expectation Suites:** A collection of related Expectations, which can be easily reused and applied across different data batches or pipelines.  
* **Data Profiling:** Great Expectations can automatically profile a dataset to infer basic statistics and suggest an initial set of Expectations based on the observed data.  
* **Data Documentation:** It automatically generates human-readable, interactive Data Docs (HTML pages) from Expectations and Validation Results.  

### Visualisation and Sharing of Output

The primary way Great Expectations visualises and shares its output is through Data Docs.  This supports the single source of the truth for data quality.  These can be hosted locally or via cloud storage, and accessible via a web browser for all team members.  Trigger notifications can be defined to email results, such as abnormal findings.

Data Docs are a set of static HTML pages that are automatically generated by the library. These include:

* A clear description of the data quality rules defined.
* Validation results showing which Expectations passed and which failed, along with detailed statistics and any unexpected values.
* Data Profiling Results, containing descriptive statistics for the dataset, often included in the overview.

## Application:  

Great Expectations is widely used across industries to standardize data quality processes and prevent "silent data errors" (data issues that don't cause a pipeline to fail but lead to incorrect results).  

* Finance - Validating market data freshness (e.g., ensuring stock prices are no older than a specified time) for trading models. Checking the integrity and completeness of customer transaction records or loan application data. Ensuring regulatory compliance by validating data against strict schema and value constraints.  
* Retail - Ensuring inventory accuracy by validating that product codes, prices, and stock counts fall within expected ranges and formats. Validating customer purchase data for uniqueness, non-null values, and correct data types before running personalized marketing or sales analytics.  
* Manufacturing	Validating the freshness and integrity of IoT sensor data from production lines for predictive maintenance (e.g., ensuring temperature readings are within a safe operating range and are arriving consistently). Checking the schema and completeness of quality control and defect logs.  
* Technology - Validating user event logs for correct structure and required fields before feeding them into analytics platforms. Ensuring model input data for Machine Learning pipelines meets required statistical distributions and schema before training or inference. Validating data consistency across microservices and data warehouses.
