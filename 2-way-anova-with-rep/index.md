## Application:  

Details of how this is applicable to multiple industries to solve business problems, generate insight and provide tangible business benefits. 


## Methodology:  

Details of the methodology applied in the project.

A Two-Way ANOVA with replication is a statistical method used to determine how two categorical independent variables (factors) affect a continuous dependent variable. The "with replication" part is crucial: it means testing multiple subjects or trials for every possible combination of the two factors.

This specific setup allows measurement of the Interaction Effect — whether the effect of one factor depends on the level of the other factor.

This is a powerful tool utilised by many sectors for multiple different reasons and benefits.

* **Manufacturing: Quality Control & Production** Engineers often use this tool to optimise machine settings across different shifts or materials.  
  * For example a car manufacturer tests the tensile strength of a metal part, where two primary factors exist; Machine Temperature (Low vs. High), and Supplier (Company X vs. Company Y).  This test can prevent "hidden" failures. This might find that Company X’s metal works perfectly at low heat, but fails miserably at high heat, whereas Company Y is stable across both. A standard one-way test would miss this interaction.  
* **Retail: Marketing and Consumer Behaviour** Retailers use this to understand how different demographics respond to various promotional strategies.  
  * For example a clothing brand measures Total Sales Volume, analysing the effect of two primary factors; Promotion Type (Discount Code vs. Free Gift), and Region (Urban vs. Rural).  This test can identify hyper-localization. The brand might discover that urban customers respond significantly better to "Free Gifts," while rural customers prefer "Discount Codes." This allows for targeted marketing spend rather than a "one size fits all" approach.


## Results and conclusions:

Results from the project related to the business objective.

### Conclusions:

Conclusions from the project findings and results.

## Next steps:  

With any analysis it is important to assess how the model and application of the analytical methods can be used and evolved to support the business goals and business decisions and yield tangible benefits.
