title: Breast Cancer Predictions (Random Forest)

permalink: /random-forest/

---

#### This project is in development

## Goals and objectives:

The business objective is to predict the cancer status of cells (benign or malignant) based on 30 features of the cells observed via digitised images. A previous project built a decision tree model achieving an accuracy of 93.86%, and the goal is to research if using a Random Forest predictor can produce more accurate results, and produce more insights into the data supporting the predictions.

This follows on from the Decision Tree project found [here](https://marcgrover-datascience.github.io/decision-trees/)

## Application:  

Details of how this is applicable to multiple industries to solve business problems, generate insight and provide tangible business benefits.

### Conclusions:

Conclusions from the project findings and results.

## Next steps:  

With any analysis it is important to assess how the model and application of the analytical methods can be used and evolved to support the business goals and business decisions and yield tangible benefits.
