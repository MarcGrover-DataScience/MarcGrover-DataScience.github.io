# Marc Grover - Data Science Portfolio 
Welcome to my collection of Data Science projects built in Python demonstrating key Data Science techniques to solve business problems and provide insights and evidence to support business decisions.  

These demonstrate key techniques using a range of machine learning and artificial intelligence methods and capabilities, utilising leading python libraries.  

Each project describes the insights and knowledge gained, and their applicability to a range of business situations.  It is vital to understand how these provide tangible benefits.  

The data used is either freely available or generated as part of the project.  None of the projects are actual business solutions and analysis that I have build, but demonstrate the techniques and applicability.

The projects are not just a collection of techniques, but walk through a mind-set that a Data Scientist must go through, including exploratory data exploration (EDA), data preparation, analysis, interpreting results, reaching conclusions, and providing recommendations.  These reflect real-world implementation, including suggested next steps.

While the examples are simple for the sake of clarity, they demonstrate the power, flexibility and scalability of analytical techniques and solutions.
