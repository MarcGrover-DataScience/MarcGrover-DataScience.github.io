permalink: /arima/

---

#### This project is in development

## Goals and objectives:

The business objective is to predict monthly air passenger volumes using historical observations.  The Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) technique was selected for this purpose as it is a powerful time-series analysis tool that can factor in seasonality and trends within time-series data, to determine patterns and build a prediction model.

The model built reached an accuracy of...

## Application:  

The Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model is a powerful statistical technique for time series forecasting, making it invaluable across various business sectors. By decomposing and modelling the trend, seasonality, and random noise in historical data, ARIMA provides precise, short-to-medium-term predictions that enable proactive strategic and operational decisions.

ARIMA techniques can be applied to many real-world scenarios, yielding benefits across numerous industries by providing insights and supporting decision-making.  Example benefits include the following:

* **Finance: Risk Management and Market Prediction** - ARIMA is used to forecast highly volatile and continuous data streams, supporting investment and risk management strategies.
  * Short-Term Price Forecasting - predicting stock prices and exchange rates to inform trading decisions and setting market positions
  * Volatility Forecasting - modelling the variation of financial time series, to predict prediod of high market risk
  * Financial Metric Forecasting - Predicting key economic indicators like inflation rates or interest rate movements to guide long-term financial planning and capital allocation.
* **Manufacturing: Production & Quality Optimisation** - 

Details of how this is applicable to multiple industries to solve business problems, generate insight and provide tangible business benefits.
