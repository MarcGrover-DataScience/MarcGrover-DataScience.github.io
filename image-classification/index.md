#### This project is in development

## Goals and objectives:

The business objective is to automatically label images by applying a classification to each. 

## Application:  

Image classification is one of the foundational applications of computer vision, enabling machines to understand and label the content of a visual scene. Its real-world applications are vast, driving automation and decision-making across almost every major sector.  

* **Manufacturing** - primarily used for quality assurance, reducing waste, and automating visual inspection tasks that are tedious or impossible for human eyes to sustain at high speed. Use cases include; defect detection,  quality control, competent sorting and safety compliance.  
* **Technology** - foundational to user interfaces, search engines, and advanced automated systems.  Examples include; Autonomous Vehicles, Image Search & Tagging, Facial Recognition, and Document Classification    
* **Science** - accelerates research, automates diagnostics, and allows for large-scale environmental monitoring.  Key areas of benefits include; Medical Diagnostics, Pathology & Histology, Agriculture (Crop Health), and Astronomy/Biology Research  
* **Retail** - generally focussed on optimising store operations, improving inventory accuracy, and enhancing the customer experience.  Use cases include; Shelf and Planogram Monitoring, Visual Search (E-commerce), Automated Checkout, and Fashion Analysis
