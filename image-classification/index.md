#### This project is in development

## Goals and objectives:

The business objective is to automatically label images by applying a classification to each.  A proof-of-concept was built to demonstrate the capability, utilising exisiting image classification models, and existing images.

The result was an application that could accurately classify images without any fine-tuning or transfer learning of the model, which demonstrated the concept and the potential business aplication and beenfits.

## Application:  

Image classification is one of the foundational applications of computer vision, enabling machines to understand and label the content of a visual scene. Its real-world applications are vast, driving automation and decision-making across almost every major sector.  

* **Manufacturing** - primarily used for quality assurance, reducing waste, and automating visual inspection tasks that are tedious or impossible for human eyes to sustain at high speed. Use cases include; defect detection,  quality control, competent sorting and safety compliance.  
* **Technology** - foundational to user interfaces, search engines, and advanced automated systems.  Examples include; Autonomous Vehicles, Image Search & Tagging, Facial Recognition, and Document Classification    
* **Science** - accelerates research, automates diagnostics, and allows for large-scale environmental monitoring.  Key areas of benefits include; Medical Diagnostics, Pathology & Histology, Agriculture (Crop Health), and Astronomy/Biology Research  
* **Retail** - generally focussed on optimising store operations, improving inventory accuracy, and enhancing the customer experience.  Use cases include; Shelf and Planogram Monitoring, Visual Search (E-commerce), Automated Checkout, and Fashion Analysis  

## Methodology:  

The Image Classification application uses the 'google/vit-base-patch16-224' model via Hugging Face, which is a popular Vision Transformer model pre-trained on 14 minillion images, with additional fine-tuning on a million images.  The Vision Transformer is a transformer encoder model based on the BERT architecture.

## Results and conclusions:

Results from the project related to the business objective.

### Conclusions:

Conclusions from the project findings and results.

## Next steps:  

With any analysis it is important to assess how the model and application of the analytical methods can be used and evolved to support the business goals and business decisions and yeild tangible benefits.
