## Application:  

Details of how this is applicable to multiple industries to solve business problems, generate insight and provide tangible business benefits. 

Association Rule Learning is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to discover interesting relationships, patterns, and dependencies between variables in large datasets.  

At its core, the algorithm identifies "if-then" relationships — for example, if a customer buys product A, then they are likely to also buy product B. 

These rules are evaluated using three key metrics:  
* support (how frequently the itemset appears in the dataset)  
* confidence (the probability that the consequent occurs given the antecedent)  
* lift (how much more likely the association is compared to random chance)  

The most well-known algorithm for implementing this technique is the Apriori algorithm, though more efficient alternatives like FP-Growth are widely used in practice.  

In a real-world retail context, Association Rule Learning is the engine behind product recommendation engines and physical store layout optimisation. A supermarket chain, for example, could apply this technique to millions of transaction records to discover that customers who purchase nappies and baby formula on weekday evenings also frequently purchase beer.  This seemingly counterintuitive insight — famously observed in early retail analytics — could inform targeted promotions, shelf placement decisions, or personalised email campaigns.  

Beyond retail, the technique finds application in healthcare (identifying co-occurring symptoms or medications), cybersecurity (detecting patterns in network intrusion events), and web analytics (understanding click-path behaviour across a site).


## Methodology:

## Conclusions:

Conclusions from the project findings and results.

## Next steps:  

With any analysis it is important to assess how the model and application of the analytical methods can be used and evolved to support the business goals and business decisions and yield tangible benefits.
