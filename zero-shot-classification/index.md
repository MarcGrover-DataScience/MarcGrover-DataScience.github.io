## Goals and objectives:

A book store wishes to categorise each book in its inventory to support the physical layout of the store and also enable a better customer experience on their website.  The categories are:  Science Fiction, Romance, Mystery, Adventure, Fantasy, Historical, and Biography.  It also wishes to understand if it is possible to classify books as fiction or non-fiction based on the description, and if the target audience can similarly be identified (children, young adults, or adults).

As well as classifying the current inventory of books, the book store wishes to build a simple app where a user can provide a book description and a category is generated by the classifier model.

A simple classification model was built using zero-shot classification utilising a publicly available model from Hugging Face (facebook/bart-large-mnli).

The model returned the most probable category for each book, with a high accuracy as determined from human validation, to a quality meeting the original business goal.

However, it was determined that the model was not good at predicting if books are fiction or non-fiction from the description alone, based on human validation of the classifications.  As such this level of classification was not included in the model.  Based on the description alone it is logical that it the model cannot determine if the content is based on true events or fictional events.

Similarly, the research to apply classifications for the target audience produced results that weren't accurate.  The classifications are based on the content of the books including children, young adults or adults, rather than them being the target audience.

## Application:  

Zero-shot classification models allow AI systems to categorize inputs—such as text, images, or data—into classes they have never been trained on by leveraging a pre-existing understanding of language and context. This capability is vital for tasks involving new, rare, or evolving categories, eliminating the need for expensive and time-consuming manual data labelling and model retraining.  Examples of applications include:

* Financial institutions automatically classifying a company into its correct industry or sector (e.g., using Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) categories) based on its textual description, annual reports, or business activities.
* Categorizing incoming customer emails, support tickets, or regulatory filings into specific processing queues (e.g., "new loan application," "compliance inquiry," "account dispute") based on the text, even for a new type of complaint or query that was just introduced.
* Sorting customer feedback or product reviews into specific, potentially new categories like "app performance bug," "delivery service issue," or "sustainable packaging concern" without needing a pre-labelled dataset for the new category.
* Automatically categorizing unstructured text data from maintenance logs or sensor alerts (e.g., "abnormal vibration detected in CNC machine axle") into specific maintenance tasks or severity levels.
* Classifying new, zero-day malware or previously unknown phishing email patterns based on their behavioural attributes or content. The model classifies the threat by comparing its features to a semantic description of known threat families.

## Methodology:  

A workflow in Python was developed using libraries Pandas, Numpy and Transformers, connecting to a zero-shot classification model in Hugging Face.  The main test used the model 'facebook/bart-large-mnli', with tests also run using 'roberta-large-mnli'.  The model was built to take the book description as an input to the model, which would produce confidence scores for each of the 7 categories, and the category with the highest confidence score was used as the classification applied to the book. To classify the whole inventory of approximately 50 thousand books, the pipeline was built to classify all the books as part of the same process.

The set of books and descriptions in the current inventory were applied to the classification model to produce the most likely category, based solely on the description.

A web app was developed using Gradio allowing a user to insert a book description and the app will use the Zero-Shot Classification model to generate the scores of the most likely category, where it lists the confidence score for each of the 7 possible categories.

Data preparation:  The original data was the "Goodreads' Best Books Ever" dataset, available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabchaki/goodreads-best-books-ever), which was used without any text cleansing and preprocessing. 

## Results and conclusions:

A sample of the results of the inventory classification is below, which provided a category for each of the 50 thousand books in the inventory.  The accuracy was to a sufficiently high level noting that the definition of 'correct' is subjective.  Two separate models from Hugging Face were used for classifications with the results compared to determine the most accurate method.  The models used were 'facebook/bart-large-mnli' and 'roberta-large-mnli', where the results showed that the 'facebook/bart-large-mnli' was the more accurate of the two.

The 'Book Genre Classifier' app was deployed in a temporary environment on-line and produced accurate and timely results for any textual description provided.  The screenshot below shows the output of one example book description.

In summary, the classification model met the business requirements for classifying the inventory of books, and the 'Book Genre Classifier' app similarly met the requirements, both in terms of quality of output and time to generate results.

### Conclusions:

The primary conclusion is that it is possible to create a model to classify books in an accurate and timely manner, which can be applied to mutliple records of book descriptions, which addresses the initial business objective.  

The overall conclusions are:
* A zero-shot classification model can categorise text without labelled data.  
* A zero-shot classification model can be quickly deployed, with low upfront costs and time.  
  * Utilising python and associated libraries using freely avaialable resources.  
* It highlights the power of using Deep Learning models to solve business problems and provide tangible benefits, and the accessibility of such models.
* Tangible operational efficiencies and savings can be made, freeing up staff for higher-value tasks
* The outputs may not be 100% accurate but the designs are open to additional development and configuration to improve results.

## Next steps:  

While the output of the model met the business requirements, there are recommendations for extending the model to increase accuracy, and extend the information that is provided by the model.

Recommendations include:
* Undertake data cleansing and preprocessing of the book descriptions prior to being applied to the classification model
* Identify additional descriptions for each book from oher sources, potentially utilising the unique ISBN code for each book to map to other descriptions of each book
* Implement RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to augment the descriptions with additional data, to allow better handling of vague or ambiguous descriptions.
* Implement Fine-Tuning on the model using labelled datasets where descriptions are mapped to classifications.
* Multi-category results, e.g. using the top 2 categories
* Hierarchical categories, for example sub-categories of 'Adventure'
* Applying other classifications such as themes of the book
* Experiment with other zero-shot classification models and determine if better results can be generated
